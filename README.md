Hi, I'm Conor, currently an undergraduate student at UC Riverside studying Computer Science. I work as a Software Engineering Intern at the UCR School of Business, where I continue to grow my technical and collaborative skills. I'm deeply interested in exploring machine learningâ€”particularly large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. My long-term goal is to become a machine learning engineer and help develop intelligent systems that create real-world impact.
